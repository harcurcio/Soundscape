A Morning Stroll in Ireland

What I've included is my Soundscape project so far, up to around the 1:15 mark - you can stop listening at that point, the rest is untrimmed layers. In this is the rough version of the listeners journey through Ireland during the morning. The walk starts with the listener leaving their house which is signified by the door sound 
at the beginning. The environment of being on the Ireland coast is created by layering sounds of waves and wind throughout the entire Soundscape. In keeping with the Ireland theme, I introduced a layer of sheep noises and bells for the listener, decreasing the volume at the beginning and end of the layer to gived the effect of walk to and away from the sheep. A few seconds later, the listener hears some birds chirping. I did the same effect for this as I did with the sheep to immitate how it would sound during a walk. I plan on adding thunder and then some rain to the Soundscape, followed with a conclusion of the door opening and closing again, signifying the end of the walk. I also need to add my personal recorded audio; I am still in the process of figuring out what that audio should be (it was going to be the rain but I do not think it is supposed to rain this week anymore).
