# Reflection

When I started my Soundscape, I wanted to create a peaceful morning walk on the Ireland coast. I immediately ran into a few issues. The most obvious being how to create the feeling that the listener is really in Ireland. I started to think about things common to Ireland rural lands, and thought of sheep. I then altered my simple morning walk to a morning walk on your farm in Ireland. I believe that this added a decent amount of immersive setting without being too on the nose. To convey the idea that you are walking and passing many different things on this walk, I edited the volume on the layers of the sheep, birds, etc. I made it so that the layers would start out quiet - to signify they are far away - then increase in volume to signify that you are closer to said object. After adding in the layers of the sheep and the birds chirping, I realized my soundscape was still on the shorter side, and I was running out of ideas for what the listener could realistically run into in rural Ireland. I decided to add in a storm; not only would this add length to the soundscape, but would give a sensible reason for the walk to end. My new plan included using my own recording of rain, but it (shockingly) ended up not raining for about a week in Pittsburgh, so I had to use a prerecorded version. Instead of recording rain for my own layer, I decided I could record the sound of the door opening and closing as the listener returns home from their journey. The issue I ran into with this idea was that since I only have my phone to record, the recording ended up being too noisy and it interrupted the atmosphere of the soundscape. I instead went to a park and recorded the sound of some crickets and used that to add to the feeling of being in a lush, green space.
