Soundscape Narrative for ENGCMP 0610

A Morning Stroll in Ireland by Harlie Curcio

# Introduction
This soundscape details a listeners journey through their Ireland farmland during the morning. The walk starts with the listener leaving their house and closing their door behind them. The environment of being on the coast of Ireland is created by layering sounds of waves and wind throughout the entire Soundscape. To enforce the idea that you are on a farm, I introduced a layer of sheep noises and bells for the listener, decreasing the volume at the beginning and end of the layer to give the effect of walking to and away from the sheep. A few seconds later, the listener hears some birds and crickets chirping. I did the same effect for this as I did with the sheep to immitate how it would sound during a walk, increasing volume as distance to the object decreases. About halfway through the walk, the listener begins to hear some distant thunder. This is soon after followed with some rain that increases in heaviness over time and more frequent rumbles of thunder. You - the listener - decided to head back home and dry off, opening and closing your door again, safe and dry in your home.
